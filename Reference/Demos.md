**Show:** Controlling 6-7 TurtleBots at once.

**Oral Presentation:** Hi, my name is Chester. I am a fourth-year undergrad student studying robotic engineering at KMTIL in Thailand. I have been working with SaPHaRl lab as an internship student since this Summer. My internship project focuses on the TurtleBots. The goal is to be able to communicate with all 7 robots at once. Enables the TurtleBots to move as a swarm and finally have them interact with people and see how they react.

Today I am going to show you how to control 5 TurtleBots to move in the same direction at the same time. Here  is how it works. Briefly, I make Raspberry Pi 1-6 communicate with each other. Raspberry Pi 1 send the command to control the rest of the Raspberry Pi in same direction at the same time. In this case, I have named each one differently so that they can receive and understand the commands correctly.

The future direction of this work is to use them as a swarm to potentially help people arriving at HFI navigate the space.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Show demo.

**Edited Oral Presentation:** Hi, my name is Chester. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student studying robotic engineering at KMTIL in Thailand. I have been working with SaPHaRl lab as an internship student since this summer. My project focuses on using the TurtleBots. Our goal is to see how humans respond to different numbers of robots greeting them and showing them around the Human Fusions Institute. We are interested in exploring how the robot behavior should change depending on how many robots meet a person.
  
Today, I am going to show you how to control six TurtleBots to move in the same direction simultaneously. We upgraded all seven TurtleBots to run on Raspberry Pis instead of the NVIDIA Jetson single-board computer.  We designate one Raspberry Pi as the “master,” which simultaneously sends the command to control the other six Raspberry Pis in the same direction. We named each robot differently so that they can receive and understand the commands correctly. We can also directly teleoperate and control each robot individually.

How would you feel if a robot greeted you and showed you around the lab? Would your opinion change if it was one robot to show you around compared to six or seven?

Would you like to control one? Show demo.
