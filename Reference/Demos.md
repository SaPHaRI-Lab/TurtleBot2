**Show:** Controlling 6-7 TurtleBots at once.

**Oral Presentation:** Hi, my name is Chester. I am a fourth-year undergrad student studying robotic engineering at KMTIL in Thailand. I have been working with SaPHaRl lab as an internship student since this Summer. My internship project focuses on the TurtleBots. The goal is to be able to communicate with all 7 robots at once. Enables the TurtleBots to move as a swarm and finally have them interact with people and see how they react.

Today I am going to show you how to control 5 TurtleBots to move in the same direction at the same time. HereÂ  is how it works. Briefly, I make Raspberry Pi 1-6 communicate with each other. Raspberry Pi 1 send the command to control the rest of the Raspberry Pi in same direction at the same time. In this case, I have named each one differently so that they can receive and understand the commands correctly.

The future direction of this work is to use them as a swarm to potentially help people arriving at HFI navigate the space.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Show demo.
