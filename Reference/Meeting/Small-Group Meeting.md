Make a project plan for Fall Semester.


### 1st | September 3rd, 2024

[Fall | 1st | Path Planning & ROS 2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tCsQanxvls6BLPP_sbjQ3Q1yQnOed9yRa5Zvo4SLzBg/edit?usp=sharing)

- Expand the limitation of the Raspberry Pi
- Research
	- Distance Sensor
	- Tour Guide Robot
	- Office Robot
- Read 2 documents (In SaPHaRI drive)
	- How to read paper
	- Primer for Conducting Experiments in HRI


### 2nd | September 10th, 2024

[Fall | 2nd | Path Planning & Communication & Object detection](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vddYcBRm07Pz5tnCfKBQbD0pOc2AUjzkZXdTrmfxIQo/edit?usp=sharing)

- Path Planning
	- Use other computer to improve processing power
- Communication
	- Build new teleop file instead of edit it directly
- Consider
	- FOV for person
	- Hallway depth
	- Robot
		- Distance to person
- Our Project
	- Focusing on
		- How does the spatial configuration of tour guide robots affect...?
		- Following distance
		- Number of robots
		- Spatial distribution (180 POV vs full 360)
	- How does robot behavior affect...?
		- Different styles of music
- Research
	- General sound of movement
	- Robotics & Sound


### 3rd | September 17th, 2024

**A bit behind the plan** 
- Path Planning
	- Try to do ROS publish and subscribe instead
	- Neuro Reality
		- To stream data
	- Checking the speed of sending data (use ROS command)
- Other update
	- If we can do path planning before next meeting; the meeting can be skip!


### 4th | September 24th, 2024

[Fall | 4th | Path Planning & Communication & Object detection](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gl0PDvwv_8z4YSAAstxr5Q-XXCOAMZjoCHSpwODfhQE/edit?usp=share_link)

- Path Planning
	- [The robot's start position is off. Planing will always fail](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/102710/noetic-rtabmap-move-basei-cannot-resolve-the-error-the-robots-start-positi)
	- [Unable to get starting pose of robot, unable to create global plan]([https://answers.ros.org/question/58796/move_base-warning-unable-to-get-starting-pose-of-robot-unable-to-create-global-plan/](https://answers.ros.org/question/58796/move_base-warning-unable-to-get-starting-pose-of-robot-unable-to-create-global-plan/ "https://answers.ros.org/question/58796/move_base-warning-unable-to-get-starting-pose-of-robot-unable-to-create-global-plan/"))
- Communication
	- [RGB and Depth images out of sync](https://answers.ros.org/question/46280/reg-subscribing-to-depth-and-rgb-image-at-the-same-time/)
- Research
	- LiDAR sensor and buy it (1 piece)
	- Charging Station (Additional)
	- Kaleb's
		- Designing door opening mechanism
	- Chester's
		- Doorbell (to sending the signal)
		- Office beacons
- Other update
	- Dr. Block connect us to last author


### 5th | October 1st, 2024

[Fall | 5th | Path Planning & Research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R9HKMAPdzUN7GNVBjQcfk2W7qSU73n1ck9ft6LzE6Oc/edit?usp=sharing)

- Path Planning
	- Should done configuration before next meeting
- Research: Doorbell and Beacons should be in the same platform? Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
	- Doorbell
		- Looking for Smart Doorbell (including speaker and screen)
	- Beacons
		- To set goal locations
		- Might needs physical
	- Mechanism door opening
		- Method 1
	- LiDAR Sensor
		- Looking for RPLIDAR A1M8
	- Charging Station
		- We should by it
	- Additional Security
		- Set the hours?
- Other updates
	- Meeting
		- Donor Meeting on October 2nd, 2024
	- Demos
		- 3 Demos in this month - October 8, 28, 30th, 2024


### 6th | October 8th, 2024

[Fall | 6th | Path Planning & Research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KN8HEZ7Km-To96Fq2wMu-KL5QfT2asIITFljo7vklZU/edit?usp=sharing)

- Path Planning
	- Done!
	- Map larger area
- Research
	- Doorbell
		- 2 Doorbell
			- TurtleBot
			- Human
		- Record data
			- When the visitor arrives at HFI, how many times the visitor rings the doorbell? For humans or robots also record the date and time
			- Example: record 1 as robot, 2 as human
	- Mechanism door opening
		- Order Flipper Zero
	- LiDAR Sensor
		- Confirm RPLIDAR A1M8
	- Security
		- Set hours
			- 10am-4pm
- Other updates
	- IRB Google form
		- Kaleb should do too!
	- Return the controller and order the new one
