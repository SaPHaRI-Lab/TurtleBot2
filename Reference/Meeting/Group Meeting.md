### 1st | September 30th, 2024

**Lab Meeting:**
Next lab meeting, meet two weeks from today, at **12:30 p.m.** on **September 12th, 2024**

**Discussion Items:**
September 5th, 2024 at 1 p.m., we are having a visit from Michael Dolsak. **Austin, Noah, Chester, and Jacob** volunteered to demo their work or talk about their project.

Dr. Block purchased a subscription to the Noun Project, a great website that creates customizable icons.

Google Groups for all the equipment. [Instruction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lnYLSR1WywN3m4WGoWTwu7-t9PPTkB5m6vJlNpMBOR4/edit?usp=sharing)

**Individual Updates:**
We went in *decreasing* order of time in the lab.

**Kaleb** - April/May 2024
- **Introduction:** Kaleb is a second-year studying computer science with a math minor. He collaborates with Chester on the TurtleBot.
- **Accomplishments:** He's been investigating the potential use of ROS2 with the Turtlebots, which requires a lot of research.
- **Challenges:** There's a lot of information to process, and he's been having difficulty deciding whether ROS1 or ROS2 is more feasible for this semester's project.
- **Goals:** To make a final decision on which ROS version to use and the subsequent tools needed. Also to figure out any hardware purchases.
- **Lesson:** An improved life makes improved work.

**Chester** - May 2024
- **Introduction:** Chester is an undergraduate internship student from Thailand. I am working on a research project focusing on TurtleBot.
- **Accomplishments:** He completed his summer internship and will continue this fall semester. in his summer internship, he upgraded all TurtleBots, was able to communicate between several at a time, and has been working on implementing real-time mapping with RTAB-MAP.
- **Challenges:** His new challenge is to use the TurtleBots to help people arriving at HFI navigate the space (the TurtleBot will deploy to greet them and navigate them to their desired destination). To complete his new challenge, he needs to do the path planning to see whether he can implement real-time mapping, but he still cannot do the path planning.
- **Goals:** He wants to get the path planning working by next week.
- **Lesson:** Two heads are better than one! (Happy to see Kaleb in person)


### 2nd | September 12th, 2024

**Lab Meeting:**
Next lab meeting, meet two weeks from today, at **12:30 p.m.** on **September 26th, 2024**

**Quotes by Chester:**
"I was NOT wrong" - Dr. Block, re: Susan's last name
"Tell us how to fix it instead of ... this suck, this suck, this suck: Professionalism please" - Dr. Block
"I'm just so cool and fun this week!" - Noah
"That's mandatory!" - Chester, re: listening to the Six: The Musical (because the TurtleBots are named after the characters)
"It's not mandatory, but it's definitely mandatory" - Austin, re: Lab lunch

**Discussion Items:**
Website update? (People, equipment/robots, projects?) -> Can everyone please share their project photos with Noah so he can put a thumbnail image up with a **short research description for each project?** (Please run the description by me first for editing)
Project description point people:
Affect-sensing: Noah
**TurtleBots: Chester** 
AstroPsych: Austin
Compliant: Jacob
Baxter Greeting: Andrew

Documentation, documentation, documentation! This is **so** important for knowledge transfer and retention.

If you are planning to conduct a user study, please sign up for an IRB account:
[IRB account](https://case.edu/research/compliance/human-research-protection-program/cwru-institutional-review-board) 
Click the link that says "SpartaIRB New User Request"
Please do not wait, do this as soon as possible so we don't encounter a delay in our study being processed. 

**Individual Updates:**
We went in *increasing* order of the number of musicals you've seen.

**Chester** - 2 Musicals (The Lion King, Frozen)
- **Introduction:** I'm Chester, I'm an undergrads internship student from Thailand. I'm working on a research project focusing on TurtleBot.
- **Accomplishments:** Did a lot of research for his project: investigated additional sensors, checked the limitations of the Raspberry Pi, read relevant research papers (tour guide, office robot). We are now interested in investigating whether the distance a robot should stay to a person scales with number of robots and perhaps the hallway width. Thank you Kaleb for fixing the computer. I did not know the password - so I added a new user, which works.
- **Challenges:** I still facing problems with path planning. The Raspberry pi has limitation processing power, so the plan is to stream the data to another computer.
- **Goals:** Finish path planning using an external computer.
- **Lesson:** We should read fundamental work/research no matter what how old they are. Recent works are good but not as always.

**Kaleb** - unknown # of musicals
- **Introduction:** Kaleb is a second-year studying CS who works on the TurtleBots with Chester.
- **Accomplishments:** He caught up to speed with the new lab (he was out for the summer), and is experimenting with TurtleBot scripts, and repaired a computer.
- **Challenges:** Though not necessarily technical, he.s been struggling a bit with time management to spend more time experimenting with the bots.
- **Goals:** He (and Chester) hopes to move the TurtleBots with basic pathfinding autonomously.
- **Lesson:** He advises to take good rest.


### 3rd | September 26th, 2024

**Lab Meeting:**
Next lab meeting, meet two weeks from today, at **12:30 p.m.** on **October 10th, 2024**

*Anything almost ready to submit or waiting for edits:*
Chester sent Dr. Block description of research for Noah; Dr. Block will edit it soon.

**Discussion Items:**
There will be a visitor on Tuesday, 8 October 2024, 1:30-2:30 p.m. Dr. Block needs to test the demos ahead of time and check the oral presentation.

Austin recommends using Projects and Teams in GitHub to help us stay organized as our lab grows. Austin gave a quick run-down on how to separate things: 
- Click projects, create a project, and it turns into a project management tool that links with the repository 
- Click teams —> create a team (do team visibility, visible) —> add members (Dr. Block **must** be a member of your team) —> go to repositories —> click add repository, search the name, and assign it to your team- you can assign repositories to a team, then you can filter all the repositories by team

**On October 2** (Wednesday next week), a potential donor is visiting HFI to tour the facility to learn more about our work. He is bringing his daughter, who is considering coming to CWRU for medical school. Dr. Tyler would like some students to be involved with this meeting at 3 p.m. Would anyone be available to meet at that time? If so, I will put you in touch with Simone. **She is looking for 1-2 students.** Thank you, Chester, for offering.

**Individual Updates:**
We went in *increasing* order of number of items on your to-do list.

**Kaleb** - Activity
- **Introduction:** Kaleb is a second-year studying CS who works on the TurtleBots with Chester.
- **Accomplishments:** He investigated Robostack and can communicate with the TurtleBots through Docker.
- **Challenges:** He's been having trouble with Rviz loading with the TurtleBot, and he and Chester struggle with effectively streaming the mapping data.
- **Goals:** He hopes to successfully work with Docker + TurtleBot 2, designing a remote-controlled lever, and successfully mapping environment.
- **Lesson:** If you spend 3 hours fixing a bug, take a break! Please.

**Chester** - 3 things (sending documentation to home institution)
- **Introduction:** I'm Chester, I'm an undergrads internship student from Thailand. I'm working on a research project focusing on TurtleBot.
- **Accomplishments:** After accessing the computer beside my desk, I could map lab areas much faster and configure the move_base file. To stream data from Raspberry Pi into the computer, I also changed the ROS command of rtab-map. So I got less warning of RGB and Depth images out of sync.
- **Challenges:** Even though I can map lab areas from the computer. I still can't save the map. To launch the move_base file after I got rid of all errors I still got some warnings like "The robot's start position is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail". If I can initialize the position of the robot it might help.
- **Goals:** Get path planning done. Fill out the IRB Google Form, and finish research on doorbell and office beacons
- **Lesson:** Never stop looking for answers, even if it like looking for a needle in the ocean.


### 4th | October 10th, 2024

**Lab Meeting:**
Next lab meeting, meet two weeks from today, at **1:30 p.m.** on **October 29th, 2024**

**Discussion Items:**
We are having a **Halloween party at Dr. Block’s house**. It will be Saturday evening, 26 October from 6-9 p.m. **Costumes are “semi-mandatory”** meaning not required, but highly encouraged. You may also bring your significant other, please just let Dr. Block so she prepares enough food!

We have so many demos this month. I do apologize for the burden this puts on you guys. Unfortunately, these are arranged by HFI, and we need to support the institute. We have three “innovation days” demos. Who is available at each time?
**28 October at 2:00 p.m.** -AstroPsych (maybe), **TurtleBots (Chesterinat)**, ASW (Noah)
**30 October at 11:00 a.m.** - AstroPsych (Austin), **TurtleBots (Chesterinat)**
**31 October at 4:00 p.m.** - Baxter group (Andrew and Ashraf), AstroPsych (Austin), **TurtleBots (Chesterinat)**, ASW (Alice)

We also have the demos for the Chagrin Falls students on:
**30 October at 9:30 a.m.** 
AstroPsych (Austin), **TurtleBots (Chesterinat)**, ASW (Alice)

Our meeting/demo with Michael Dolsak has been moved a third time. He will now be visiting **29 October at 12:30 p.m.** Who is available to demo? He is particularly interested in projects with medical applications.
ASW (Alice)
AstroPsych (Austin), **TurtleBots (Chesterinat)**

Per discussion, Dr. Block will create a DoodlePool for future lab visits. 

Dr. Block has to go to Germany from 2 November - 10 November to meet with some collaborators and demo my old robot (and work on purchasing it back). Would you rather:
A) Have Zoom meetings that week
B) Cancel meetings that week
**C) Email updates**
Lab decided: Dr. Block will set a date by which she wants an email update with links to a slide, she will review and email a response. If needed, we can schedule a Zoom. 
Also - I would like to bring the lab a sweet lil treat from Germany - what would you guys like? RitterSport.

**Individual Updates:**
We went in *decreasing* order of number of items in your Halloween costume.

**Kaleb** - 
- **Introduction:** Kaleb is a second-year studying CS who works on the TurtleBots with Chester.
- **Accomplishments:** He experimented with containerizing the TurtleBot runtime environment and developed door-hacking techniques. He praises Chester for saving a map successfully.
- **Challenges:** He's had trouble connecting to the Turtlebot through Docker on MacOS. After researching and trying different methods, he sadly has to abandon the ship.
- **Goals:** He plans to create a web server to communicate better between doorbells and multiple Turtlebots.
- **Lesson:** When forced to choose between two problems, take the more time-efficient one. However, it's hard to gauge that without fully trying for a solution first.

**Chester** - 0
- **Introduction:** I'm Chesturinat, I'm an undergrads internship student from Thailand. I'm working on a research project focusing on TurtleBot.
- **Accomplishments:** Can save the map and can do autonomous path planning. Set a goal and have it autonomously navigate to the goal.
- **Challenges:** Setting the robot’s initial pose helps, but he needs to configure the AMCL file before he can do that. Next step is to map the larger area. So, the challenge is at this time I can map only stationary obstacles so when people walk by while mapping my map will collapse so I need to map in the evening. Still figuring out how to detect non-stationary objects.
- **Goals:** Map the larger area especially to Dr. Block room.
- **Lesson:** Fix the errors one by one. No rush!


### 5th | October 29th, 2024

**Lab Meeting:**
Next lab meeting, meet two weeks from today, at **1:30 p.m.** on **October 29th, 2024**

**Discussion Items:**
How we divide the demo (40 students).
Wanna join the meeting or not? CFHS!
Wed next week for presentation. (I go)

We are having a **Halloween

**Individual Updates:**
We went in *decreasing* order of number of items in your Halloween costume.

**Kaleb** - 
- **Introduction:** Kaleb is a second-year studying CS who works on the TurtleBots with Chester.
- **Accomplishments:** 
- **Goals:** 
- **Lesson:** 

**Chester** - 1.15 mins
- **Introduction:** I'm Chesturinat, I'm an undergrads internship student from Thailand. I'm working on a research project focusing on TurtleBot.
- **Accomplishments:** I can map the larger area (almost to the Dr. Block room) but it is not as efficient as we want. Integrate the doorbell and RF receiver to the Raspberry Pi so whenever I press the doorbell RF receiver will receive the signal after that will enable TurtleBot to move autonomously. And also can use RPLIDAR Sensor once.
- **Challenges:** Finding new device to help mapping in order to save time (I have talked to Austin). For the doorbell need to find the maxim range and with obstacle (wall, glass) to see the maximum range to know that we need to use antenna or not. For the LiDAR Sensor it just sudden error still figure out! Because last week I still can use it. And I did not test on the non-stationary object detection avoidance that I found on Github yet.
- **Goals:** Map larger area more efficient, Find out the maximum range of RF receiver, Fix the LiDAR Sensor, and test on non-stationary object detection avoidance on Github.
- **Lesson:** Talk to pink rubber duck, its HELP!
