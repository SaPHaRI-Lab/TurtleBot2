### 1st | September 30th, 2024

**Lab Meeting:**
Next lab meeting, meet two weeks from today, at **12:30 p.m.** on **September 12th, 2024**

**Discussion Items:**
September 5th, 2024 at 1 p.m., we are having a visit from Michael Dolsak. **Austin, Noah, Chester, and Jacob** volunteered to demo their work or talk about their project.

Dr. Block purchased a subscription to the Noun Project, a great website that creates customizable icons.

Google Groups for all the equipment. [Instruction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lnYLSR1WywN3m4WGoWTwu7-t9PPTkB5m6vJlNpMBOR4/edit?usp=sharing)

**Individual Updates:**
We went in decreasing order of time in the lab.

**Kaleb** - April/May 2024
- **Introduction:** Kaleb is a second-year studying computer science with a math minor. He collaborates with Chester on the TurtleBot.
- **Accomplishments:** He's been investigating the potential use of ROS2 with the Turtlebots, which requires a lot of research.
- **Challenges:** There's a lot of information to process, and he's been having difficulty deciding whether ROS1 or ROS2 is more feasible for this semester's project.
- **Goals:** To make a final decision on which ROS version to use and the subsequent tools needed. Also to figure out any hardware purchases.
- **Lesson:** An improved life makes improved work.

**Chester** - May 2024
- **Introduction:** Chester is an undergraduate internship student from Thailand. I am working on a research project focusing on TurtleBot.
- **Accomplishments:** He completed his summer internship and will continue this fall semester. in his summer internship, he upgraded all TurtleBots, was able to communicate between several at a time, and has been working on implementing real-time mapping with RTAB-MAP.
- **Challenges:** His new challenge is to use the TurtleBots to help people arriving at HFI navigate the space (the TurtleBot will deploy to greet them and navigate them to their desired destination). To complete his new challenge, he needs to do the path planning to see whether he can implement real-time mapping, but he still cannot do the path planning.
- **Goals:** He wants to get the path planning working by next week.
- **Lesson:** Two heads are better than one! (Happy to see Kaleb in person)


### 2nd | September 12th, 2024

**Lab Meeting:**
Next lab meeting, meet two weeks from today, at **12:30 p.m.** on **September 26th, 2024**

**Quotes by Chester:**
"I was NOT wrong" - Dr. Block, re: Susan's last name
"Tell us how to fix it instead of ... this suck, this suck, this suck: Professionalism please" - Dr. Block
"I'm just so cool and fun this week!" - Noah
"That's mandatory!" - Chester, re: listening to the Six: The Musical (because the TurtleBots are named after the characters)
"It's not mandatory, but it's definitely mandatory" - Austin, re: Lab lunch

**Discussion Items:**
Website update? (People, equipment/robots, projects?) -> Can everyone please share their project photos with Noah so he can put a thumbnail image up with a **short research description for each project?** (Please run the description by me first for editing)
Project description point people:
Affect-sensing: Noah
**TurtleBots: Chester** 
AstroPsych: Austin
Compliant: Jacob
Baxter Greeting: Andrew

Documentation, documentation, documentation! This is **so** important for knowledge transfer and retention.

If you are planning to conduct a user study, please sign up for an IRB account:
[IRB account](https://case.edu/research/compliance/human-research-protection-program/cwru-institutional-review-board) 
Click the link that says "SpartaIRB New User Request"
Please do not wait, do this as soon as possible so we don't encounter a delay in our study being processed. 

**Individual Updates:**
We went in increasing order of the number of musicals you've seen.

**Chester** - 2 Musicals (The Lion King, Frozen)
- **Introduction:** I'm Chester, I'm an undergrads internship student from Thailand. I'm working on a research project focusing on TurtleBot.
- **Accomplishments:** Did a lot of research for his project: investigated additional sensors, checked the limitations of the Raspberry Pi, read relevant research papers (tour guide, office robot). We are now interested in investigating whether the distance a robot should stay to a person scales with number of robots and perhaps the hallway width. Thank you Kaleb for fixing the computer. I did not know the password - so I added a new user, which works.
- **Challenges:** I still facing problems with path planning. The Raspberry pi has limitation processing power, so the plan is to stream the data to another computer.
- **Goals:** Finish path planning using an external computer.
- **Lesson:** We should read fundamental work/research no matter what how old they are. Recent works are good but not as always.

**Kaleb** - unknown # of musicals
- **Introduction:** Kaleb is a second-year studying CS who works on the TurtleBots with Chester.
- **Accomplishments:** He caught up to speed with the new lab (he was out for the summer), and is experimenting with TurtleBot scripts, and repaired a computer.
- **Challenges:** Though not necessarily technical, he.s been struggling a bit with time management to spend more time experimenting with the bots.
- **Goals:** He (and Chester) hopes to move the TurtleBots with basic pathfinding autonomously.
- **Lesson:** He advises to take good rest.


### 3rd | September 26th, 2024

**Lab Meeting:**
Next lab meeting, meet two weeks from today, at **12:30 p.m.** on **October 10th, 2024**

**Publications:** Wearable team submit IRB

**Discuss:**

**Chester** - 
- **Introduction:** I'm Chester, I'm an undergrads internship student from Thailand. I'm working on a research project focusing on TurtleBot.
- **Accomplishments:** After accessing the computer beside my desk, I could map lab areas much faster and configure the move_base file. To stream data from Raspberry Pi into the computer, I also changed the ROS command of rtab-map. So I got less warning of RGB and Depth images out of sync.
- **Challenges:** Even though I can map lab areas from the computer. I still can't save the map. To launch the move_base file after I got rid of all errors I still got some warnings like "The robot's start position is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail". If I can initialize the position of the robot it might help.
- **Goals:** Get path planning done. Fill out the IRB Google Form, and finish research on doorbell and office beacons
- **Lesson:** Never stop looking for answers, even if it like looking for a needle in the ocean.
