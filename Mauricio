# TurtleBot2 Charging Station Project (Spring 2025)

## Project Mission

The mission of this project was to design and implement a robust, low-cost charging infrastructure that enables TurtleBot robots 
to operate fully autonomously over extended periods. Recognizing that long-term robot deployment is limited by the need for human 
intervention during battery depletion, the project developed a custom docking and wireless charging system integrated with the 
TurtleBotâ€™s onboard sensing and navigation. The solution allows robots to continuously monitor their battery state, locate the 
nearest charging station, and reliably dock and recharge without human assistance. By addressing one of the critical barriers to 
autonomy, this work contributes to the scalability of multi-robot fleets in real-world environments, advancing the vision of self-
sustaining robotic systems for research, industrial, and service applications.

## Materials bought

Several materials were bought throughout the Spring semester of 2025 to create the TurtleBot2's prototype charging station. 
The following list highlights all of the materials succesfully implemented into the prototype which are to be bought for all
the charging stations.

1. Pigtail wires: 5.5x2.1mm female. The link foor the original item bought was not found, however, the same wires can be found on 
Amazon. One pigtail wire s used per chargng station. Link: https://shorturl.at/qTmx7 (Price: $9.19 for 20 pcs)
2. Copper Tape: Two roles of tape should yield more than enough for all 7 stations (buy one more since the lab already has one). 
Important note: any coper tape can be bought as long as it is conductive. Link: https://shorturl.at/tJqcn (Prce: $7.99)
3. Silicone Pads: For more friction between the station and the surface it stands on. There are still leftover silicone pads
from the original order. Buy 1-2 more packages. Link: https://shorturl.at/9vXdI (Price: $9.99)
4. Power Supply Adaptable for Pigtal Wires: (5.5x2.1mm male). Link: https://shorturl.at/tJqcn (Price: $19.99 for each)

Total cost for all the new items bought: Approximately $157.10

Here's a list of items bought for the original charging station which did not work and should not be bought for the next ones:

1. Tungsten weights: Were bought in attempts to add more weight to the charging station so it would stay in place as the 
TurtleBot climbed on it. They were too small and too expensive. The internal power supply functions as weight. 
2. IR Transmitters: Were bought to implement the IR localization method between the charging station and TurtleBot. The
project was unsuccesful.

## CAD files

The following files were the files utilized in AutoCAD 2025 to design and 3D print the charging station prototype. As of Spring 2025
There should not be any additional changes required, but they may be done by downloading these files if necessary.
