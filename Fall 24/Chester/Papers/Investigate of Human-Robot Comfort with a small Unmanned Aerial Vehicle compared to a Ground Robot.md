**Conclusion:** 

Explores how human perceived comfort differently when interacting with drones versus ground robots. Key findings emphasize that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are perceived as less comfortable and more intimidating compared to ground robots when they operate in close proximity to people.

Crucial factors influencing comfort levels, such as speed, altitude, and movement patterns of UAVs. People generally preferred interactions with ground robots because they are perceived as less invasive and more predictable. The study also points out that clear communication and predictable behavior are crucial in reducing discomfort, especially when UAVs navigate near humans.
