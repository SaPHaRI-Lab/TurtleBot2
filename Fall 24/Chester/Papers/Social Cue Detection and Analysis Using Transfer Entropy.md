**Conclusion:**

Robots that work close to humans need to understand and use social cues to act in socially acceptable manner. They introduces a method to analyze social cues in human interactions (in context of robots working alongside humans). They use transfer entropy, an information-theoretic measure to study the flow of nonverbal and episodic communication cues.

Key findings demonstrate that transfer entropy can effectively identify when and where information flows occur between interacting agents and assess their relative influence. This work has potential applications in designing robots that are socially aware and capable of engaging with humans in more natural and intuitive ways, improving human-robot interaction and planning strategies for socially appropriate robot behavior.
