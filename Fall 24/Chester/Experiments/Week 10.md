**Objective:** Map the larger area.

**Experiment:** Map it slowly and use board to limit the space. And LiDAR Sensor not working. Also set up for the demo tomorrow.

**Result:** I can map the larger area but not efficient as we want.

**Objective:** Make LiDAR Sensor work again.

**Experiment:** I did exactly the same things.

**Result:** LiDAR Sensor back to work! (In a confused state).

**Objective:** Test the maximum range of RF that can receive. And integrate mapping with LiDAR Sensor.

**Experiment:** I tested by do the same experiment. But have some **warning** from me. I found the RF detect the frequency too good, sometime I did not even press the door button but it still enable my TurtleBot to move.
If I use LiDAR Sensor with mapping method I have no warning from AMCL file any more. The warning is "no laser scan receive".

**Result:** Did not get the result as I expected.
