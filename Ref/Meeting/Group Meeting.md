### 1st | September 30th, 2024

**Lab Meeting:**
Next lab meeting, meet two weeks from today, at **12.:30 p.m.** on **September 12th, 2024**

**Discussion Items:**
September 5th, 2024 at 1 p.m., we are having a visit from Michael Dolsak. **Austin, Noah, Chester, and Jacob** volunteered to demo their work or talk about their project.

Dr. Block purchased a subscription to the Noun Project, a great website that creates customizable icons.

Google Groups for all the equipment. [Instruction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lnYLSR1WywN3m4WGoWTwu7-t9PPTkB5m6vJlNpMBOR4/edit?usp=sharing)

**Individual Updates:**
We went in decreasing order of time in the lab.

**Kaleb** - April/May 2024
- **Introduction:** Kaleb is a second-year studying computer science with a math minor. He collaborates with Chester on the TurtleBot.
- **Accomplishments:** He's been investigating the potential use of ROS2 with the Turtlebots, which requires a lot of research.
- **Challenges:** There's a lot of information to process, and he's been having difficulty deciding whether ROS1 or ROS2 is more feasible for this semester's project.
- **Goals:** To make a final decision on which ROS version to use and the subsequent tools needed. Also to figure out any hardware purchases.
- **Lesson:** An improved life makes improved work.

**Chester** - May 2024
- **Introduction:** Chester is an undergraduate internship student from Thailand. I am working on a research project focusing on TurtleBot.
- **Accomplishments:** He completed his summer internship and will continue this fall semester. in his summer internship, he upgraded all TurtleBots, was able to communicate between several at a time, and has been working on implementing real-time mapping with RTAB-MAP.
- **Challenges:** His new challenge is to use the TurtleBots to help people arriving at HFI navigate the space (the TurtleBot will deploy to greet them and navigate them to their desired destination). To complete his new challenge, he needs to do the path planning to see whether he can implement real-time mapping, but he still cannot do the path planning.
- **Goals:** He wants to get the path planning working by next week.
- **Lesson:** Two heads are better than one! (Happy to see Kaleb in person)


### 2nd | September 12th, 2024

**Lab Meeting:**
Next lab meeting, meet two weeks from today, at **12.:30 p.m.** on **September 26th, 2024**

**Ach**

**Individual Updates:**
???

**Kaleb** - 
- **Introduction:** 
- **Accomplishments:** 
- **Challenges:** 
- **Goals:** 
- **Lesson:** 

**Chester** - 2 Musical
- **Introduction:** I'm Chester, I'm an undergrads internship student from Thailand. I'm working on a research project focusing on TurtleBot.
- **Accomplishments:** Do research for the project; additional sensors, checking the limitation of Raspberry Pi, about the tour-guide robot or office robot to determine the focus of this research whether it will be in which direction like what would be the appropriate distance between the robot and the user or the number of the robot. For path planning still working on it. Also, Thank you to Kaleb that he fixed the computer beside my desk. After that, we cannot access to the computer due we don't know the password so I try to add new user and it work.
- **Challenges:** Raspberry Pi has some limitations like processing power; Rviz consumed ~70% and RTAB-MAP consumed ~5% of it. So the solution is to try to stream the data to another computer it might help for doing path planning.
- **Goals:** Finish path planning.
- **Lesson:** We should read fundamental work/research no matter what how old they are. Recent works are good but not as always.

Quote: 
Dr. Block: "I'm not wrong" (about Susan last name), "Must be Professional!!!"
this suck this suck this suck -> tell us how to fix instead of. pls professionalism

Noah: just so cool and fun this week

Chester: Thats mandatory! (to listen the six: The Musical)

Draft -> Describe the project to Dr. Block
