- Path Planning
	- Use other computer to improve processing power
- Communication
	- Build new teleop file instead of edit it directly
- Consider
	- FOV for person
	- Hallway depth
	- Robot
		- Distance to person
- Our Project
	- Focusing on
		- How does the spatial configuration of tour guide robots affect...?
		- Following distance
		- Number of robots
		- Spatial distribution (180 POV vs full 360)
	- How does robot behavior affect...?
		- Different styles of music
- Research
	- General sound of movement
	- Robotics & Sound
