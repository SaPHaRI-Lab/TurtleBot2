Make a project plan for Fall Semester.


### 1st | September 3rd, 2024

[1st | Fall | Path Planning & ROS 2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tCsQanxvls6BLPP_sbjQ3Q1yQnOed9yRa5Zvo4SLzBg/edit?usp=sharing)

- Expand the limitation of the Raspberry Pi
- Research
	- Distance Sensor
	- Tour Guide Robot
	- Office Robot
- Read 2 documents (In SaPHaRI drive)
	- How to read paper
	- Primer for Conducting Experiments in HRI


### 2nd | September 10th, 2024

[2nd | Fall | Path Planning & Communication & Object detection](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vddYcBRm07Pz5tnCfKBQbD0pOc2AUjzkZXdTrmfxIQo/edit?usp=sharing)

- Path Planning
	- Use other computer to improve processing power
- Communication
	- Build new teleop file instead of edit it directly
- Consider
	- FOV for person
	- Hallway depth
	- Robot
		- Distance to person
- Our Project
	- Focusing on
		- How does the spatial configuration of tour guide robots affect...?
		- Following distance
		- Number of robots
		- Spatial distribution (180 POV vs full 360)
	- How does robot behavior affect...?
		- Different styles of music
- Research
	- General sound of movement
	- Robotics & Sound


### 3rd | September 17th, 2024

**A bit behind the plan** 
- Path Planning
	- Try to do ROS publish and subscribe instead
	- Neuro Reality
		- To stream data
	- Checking the speed of sending data (use ROS command)
- Other updates
	- If we can do path planning before next meeting; the meeting can be skip!
