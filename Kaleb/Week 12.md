### Door Opening Side Quest (Day 3)
- ESP32's and LiPo battery arrived! We may need a charger or some sort of cable..
- Connected the ESP32 into its USB-C hub and the computer
	- **UPDATE 11/23/24: Using VSCode instead of Arduino IDE**
	- Install the Arduino IDE
	- Following [this guide](https://samueladesola.medium.com/how-to-set-up-esp32-wroom-32-b2100060470c) to set up the ESP32 and its drivers
	- Really good [WiFi tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH3sLEQI4_w) (for later)

### System Design
- Returned the ESP32, wasn't careful enough about the LiPo system
	- Ordered the one here: [https://www.adafruit.com/product/5438](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5438 "https://www.adafruit.com/product/5438")
	- Additional WiFi antenna module: [https://www.adafruit.com/product/5445](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5445 "https://www.adafruit.com/product/5445")
- Current iteration of the integrated Door Opening System

- For Daniel, building a custom charging station for the Turtlebots would be a great starter project
	- Maybe later he can design a smart charging system? Not sure yet
