**Conclusion:** 

Children worldwide are growing more sedentary over time, leading to considerable accompanying wellness challenges. Pilot results from our research group have shown that robots may offer something different or better than other developmentally appropriate toys for motivating physical activity.

The child users experienced a teleoperated robot mode, a semi-autonomous robot mode, and a control condition during which the robot was present but inactive. Results showed that children tended to be more active when the robot was active and the teleoperated mode did not yield significantly different results than the semi-autonomous mode. These insights can guide the future application of assistive robots in child motor interventions and inform how these robots can be equipped to assist busy human clinicians.
