**Conclusion:** 

This paper describes the experiences from the iterative design of a fetch-and-carry-robot, to be used by motion-impaired people in an office environment.

These trials have also revealed that interaction design for robots should not focus only on the individual user, but that other members in the environment can be seen as "secondary users" or "bystanders" who tend to relate to the robot actively in various ways.

Furthermore, we observed that there was a need for a "near-navigation" control function to adjust the robot's preprogrammed positions. This might be generalized to provide for both an automated, supervisory type of control and a direct, manual control means for users. For service robots, it seems that both states and a transition between them are typical and need to be addressed.
