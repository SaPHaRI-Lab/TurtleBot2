**Conclusion:** 

Taking an ethnomethodological approach to show how robots become embedded in urban space both from a perspective of the social assembly of the physical environment (the streetscape) and the socially organized nature of everyday street life.

They observed Starship delivery robot, equipped with various sensors (ultrasonic, cameras, GPS, etc.) for autonomous navigation. To studying delivery robots in public is informed by ethnomethodology (EM).

Capture involved two main strategies:
- Us as researchers creating our own orders and ‘shadowing’ robots from the start
- Opportunistically following robots which were either en route to customer orders or returning to a hub

People inadvertently “grant passage” to robots in public spaces. This behavior involves humans making small adjustments to their actions, often unconsciously, allowing the robots to move through and operate within urban environments. Such human accommodation work ensures smooth interactions between pedestrians and robots.
