**Conclusion:**

The robot represent personal spaces in terms of affordance spaces attached to human, i.e., portions of physical space that can be used for interaction. The symbolic representation of personal spaces enable robots to make choices and to communicate the reasons for their choices to humans.

Knowing about available candidate affordance spaces and socio-spatial reasons provided by humans, what remains is to figure out which of the socio-spatial reasons apply to which candidate affordance spaces, given an interaction to be placed.
- 1st principle: Focused interactions should be placed at a Hallian affordance space of which it is known that the human who is the owner of the personal space accepts the use of this affordance space for the given interaction.
- 2nd principle: Activities should be placed such that the personal space of bystanders will not be invaded.

The goal of this work is to contribute to the discourse on modeling personal space for social robotics. While most existing models rely on parametrized numerical or geometric representations, this work represents personal spaces in symbolic knowledge bases. Personal spaces are defined based on affordance spaces and thus directly linked to the possibilities for interactions provided by humans.
