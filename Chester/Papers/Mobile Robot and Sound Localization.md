**Conclusion:** 

This paper describes a mobile robot with real-time sound localization and sonar systems for obstacle detection. The sound localization method is based on a model of the precedence effect of the human auditory system to cope with echoes and reverberations. Sound localization and robot navigation experiments were conducted. The results show that the robot is capable of localizing sounding objects in a reverberant environment and approaching the objects without collisions, even when the objects are behind Obstacles. Environment flexibility and error robustness of the system were discussed as well.

This paper developed a robot auditory system and demonstrated its ability to localize sound and navigate the robot in a reverberant environment. The advantages of the auditory navigation system are that it can work in poor lighting, localize invisible-sounding objects, and detect unexpected events. Further studies, including sound organization and recognition to contribute to environment recognition and human-robot communication, are also needed for the development of a robot auditory system.
