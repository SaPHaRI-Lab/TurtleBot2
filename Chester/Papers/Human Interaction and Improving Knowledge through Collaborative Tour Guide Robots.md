**Conclusion:** 

It is important to identify how these new museum guides can optimally interact with users. This paper introduces the idea of two collaborative tour guide robots. Inspired by evidence from cognitive studies stating that people remember more when they receive information from two different human speakers.

Personality/Behavior of the robot affects the human learning process; this experiment has shown that people remember significantly more information when they are guided by a cheerful robot than a serious one. Moreover, another important outcome of this study is users are more likely to two robots than a single robot.
