**Conclusion:** 

The goal is to give the tourists a smooth and pleasant experience at the tourists areas.

This paper implements a tour-guide robot using Kinect Technology to ease the process of tourist guides. The robot will replace the current human guide. The robot will use RFID to identify the item and play the correct audio file.

To improve this work adding more colors to detect to differentiate between multiple users, using RFID readers with higher detection ranges, playing audio files in more than 1 language, and adding human-interaction capability in which the robot can greet or give suggestions to users.
