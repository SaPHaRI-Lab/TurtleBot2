**Objective:** Map the larger area (to Dr. Block room)

**Experiment:** I try new setting while do the larger map as well. At first I use `/rtabmap/grib_prob_map` but in this time I use `/rtabmap/gib_map`.

![[Larger map with new setting.png]]
For my feeling I like `/rtabmap/grid_prob_map` more because the map is more reliable and more stable but map harder than `/rtabmap/grid_map`.

Have some limit due to have many people walk by so my map collapse. I need to wait until night because less people.

I tried to map a larger area from the previous one **but** even though I can map it, it does not work well. TurtleBot does not move to the goal that I set.

As I mentioned in the green circle I donâ€™t know what is that because I set the environment the same as the previous one just added the movable board. And 1 suspect is the red line because to do the larger map it over the square area.

**Result:** Not successful!
