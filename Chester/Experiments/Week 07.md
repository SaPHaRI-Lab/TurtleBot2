**Research:** Doorbell and LiDAR Sensor.
- LiDAR Sensor
	- Confirm to order **RPLIDAR A1M8** from Amazon
	- Price ~100$

- Doorbell
	- Ring video doorbell
		- Set up (follow the manual) + Connect to Wifi
	- IFTTT (If This Then That)
		- Trigger: Set the trigger to be "When Ring doorbell is pressed"
		- Action: Set the action to send the data to Raspberry Pi
	- Set up on the Raspberry Pi
		- Set up the listener on Raspberry Pi to receive the signal
		- Set up the ROS topic to trigger the TurtleBot movement

**Objective:** Map the larger area (to Dr. Block room)

**Experiment:** I try new setting while do the larger map as well. At first I use `/rtabmap/grib_prob_map` but in this time I use `/rtabmap/gib_map`.

![[Larger map with new setting.png]]
For my feeling I like `/rtabmap/grid_prob_map` more because the map is more reliable and more stable but map harder than `/rtabmap/grid_map`.

Have some limit due to have many people walk by so my map collapse. I need to wait until night because less people.

I tried to map a larger area from the previous one **but** even though I can map it, it does not work well. TurtleBot does not move to the goal that I set.

![[2nd larger map.png]]
As I mentioned in the green circle I donâ€™t know what is that because I set the environment the same as the previous one just added the movable board. And 1 suspect is the red line because to do the larger map it over the square area.

**Research:** For `/rtabmap_grid_prob_map` and `/rtab_grid_map`
- `/rtabmap_grid_prob_map`
	- Probability grid map
	- Useful for **navigation algorithms** that require a probabilistic representation of the environment.
- `/rtabmap_grid_map`
	- Occupancy grid map
	- Used for **navigation** and **path planning**, as it provides a clear binary view of the environment without probability, making it easier for path planning algorithms to decide where the robot can or cannot move

**Result:** Not successful!

**Objective:** Config the AMCL file in the rest of the Raspberry Pi and import the map to test it on.

**Experiment:** Transfer 4th map into the rest of the Raspberry Pi. Transfer the data via ssh by running this command `scp /path/to/local/file Username@IP Address:/path/to/destination /folder/`. For example: `scp /home/SaPHaRI/kobuki_ws/src/map/4thmap.yaml SaPHaRI@192.168.0.213:/home/SaPHaRI/kobuki_ws/src/turtlebot_apps/turtlebot_navigation/maps/`

If you want to transfer file with same prefix like I have `4thmap.pgm` and `4thmap.yaml` files you need to use this command `scp /home/SaPHaRI/kobuki_ws/src/map/4thmap.* SaPHaRI@192.168.0.213:/home/SaPHaRI/kobuki_ws/src/turtlebot_apps/turtlebot_navigation/maps/` instead.

Tips: If transfer file into different path to need to config the path in the `yaml` file as well. And this transfer file, transfer via ssh. So, the another Raspberry Pi must turn on as well.

Testing the path planning. 1st Raspberry Pi that I config is Raspberry Pi 6th.
- Config the AMCL file
- Checking the TF
- Transfer data from Raspberry Pi 5th
- Install PointCloud to LaserScan

And I accidentally delete file in the Raspberry Pi 2nd, So, need to reinstall.

**Result:** Not working and not finish reinstall yet but I got something new. I can get fid off the warning when we launch bring up to connect to TurtleBot. The warning is about battery warning so if you're using a Raspberry Pi without a laptop battery this warning can be ignored or remove the node from the launch file.
- Remove the node from launch file
	- `cd kobuki_ws/src/turtlebot/turtlebot_bringup/launch`
	- `nano minimal.launch`
	- Remove
```
<include unless="$(eval arg('battery') == 'None')" file="$(find turtlebot_bringup)/launch/includes/netbook.launch.xml">
    <arg name="battery" value="$(arg battery)" />
</include>
```
After remove the node. Try to launch the bring up again to see there still have warning or not.

**Objective:** Test RPLIDAR A1.

**Experiment:** Connect LiDAR sensor to Raspberry Pi.

**Result:** Not yet finish.
