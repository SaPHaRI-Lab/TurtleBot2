**1st Draft**
- Our Lab
	- Through our research, we aim to enhance the emotional and physical support provided by robots, ultimately improving the quality of life and well-being for individuals. By bridging the gap between humans and technology, we strive to create meaningful, supportive interactions that bring us closer together, even when weâ€™re physically apart.
- My Project (TurtleBot 2)
	- This project explores the interactions between humans and a group of mobile robots in a guided navigation context. Using TurtleBots upgraded with Raspberry Pis and running on ROS Noetic, we investigate how various aspects of multi-robot systems influence human reception and behavior. Our goal is to understand better how different configurations of robot behavior and environmental factors can optimize group interactions, enhance human comfort, and improve the effectiveness of robot-guided navigation in shared spaces.
