**1st Draft**
- Our Lab
	- Through our research, we aim to enhance the emotional and physical support provided by robots, ultimately improving the quality of life and well-being for individuals. By bridging the gap between humans and technology, we strive to create meaningful, supportive interactions that bring us closer together, even when we’re physically apart.
- My Project (TurtleBot 2)
	- This project explores the interactions between humans and a group of mobile robots in a guided navigation context. Using TurtleBots upgraded with Raspberry Pis and running on ROS Noetic, we investigate how various aspects of multi-robot systems influence human reception and behavior. Our goal is to understand better how different configurations of robot behavior and environmental factors can optimize group interactions, enhance human comfort, and improve the effectiveness of robot-guided navigation in shared spaces.

- Other Projects 
	- Affect-Sensing Wearable to Promote Social Interaction
		- The “Affect-Sensing Wearable” project aims to create a modular jacket that uses machine learning to interpret Bio signals and detect users emotional states. This technology allows external agents to provide emotional and physical support, enhancing social interaction through touch. By offering real-time feedback, the jacket addresses mental health needs, improves emotional communication, and promotes well-being, ultimately enhancing individuals’ quality of life.
	- Baxter Robot
		- By enhancing the robot’s greeting and physical interactions, this project seeks to foster more positive first impressions between humans and robots. With the Baxter Robot on a mobile base and a compliant gripper with tactile sensors, we aim to create smoother, more intuitive engagement. These innovations will help robots interact more naturally, making users feel more at ease. Ultimately, this research will deepen our understanding of how initial robot encounters shape long-term human-robot relationships.
	- Compliant Gripper
		- Enhances Baxter Robot’s interactions by integrating tactile sensors for more natural engagement. By improving greetings and physical touch, it fosters positive first impressions and user comfort, deepening our understanding of how initial encounters influence long-term human-robot relationships.
	- Nao Robot
		- Integration of AI offers significant potential for enhancing mental health care and social interaction. By providing personalized support and engaging users, Nao helps reduce loneliness and foster connections. As it evolves, Nao can deliver accessible interventions, empowering individuals to improve emotional well-being and strengthen social ties, making it a valuable tool for nurturing connections and resilience.

**2nd Draft**
- Lab
	- We develop empathetic robotics companion to address **mental health** concern and provide emotional support
	- Mental Health: Autism, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Depression, Grief
		- Autism: A neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave
		- PTSD: A disorder that develops in some people who have experienced a shocking, scary, or dangerous event
		- Depression: A constant feeling of sadness, which stops you doing your norma activities
		- Grief: A natural response to loss
